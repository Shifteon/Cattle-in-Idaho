# Overview

A map that visualizes the number of cattle in Idaho in every county compared to the population of the county. The map is very easy to use. The size of the circle represents the number of cattle and the color represents the population. Clicking on a circle displays a popup with more information including a pie graph to help visualize the data better. 
Data was collected from  USDA agriculture census. And the ArcGis county table.

This map is meant to be a fun way to visualize some interesting data.
